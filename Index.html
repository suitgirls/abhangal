<body>
   Hi! My name is Arya Bhangale and I'm a high school senior from Princeton Junction, New Jersey! I decided to take this class because I've always been interested in engineering and technology and I wanted to pursue different sectors of my interest. I'm specifically interested in mechanical engineering and mechatronics! My hobby includes reading, and my favorite books to read are mystery books. My favorite TV show is White Collar and How I Met Your Mother. I love robotics and I'm on my schools robotics team!
