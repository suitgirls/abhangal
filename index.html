<h1> Arya Bhangale's Biography</h1>

<h2> <p> Hi! My name is Arya Bhangale and I'm a high school senior from Princeton Junction, New Jersey! I decided to take this class because I've always been interested in engineering and technology and I wanted to pursue different sectors of my interest.</h2> </p>
    
   <p> I'm specifically interested in mechanical engineering and mechatronics! My hobby includes reading, and my favorite books to read are mystery books. My favorite TV show is <strong>White Collar</strong> and <strong>How I Met Your Mother</strong>. I love robotics and I'm on my schools robotics team! And my favorite song is Brazil by Declan Mckenna! </p>
